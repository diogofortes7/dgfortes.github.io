Hello! My name is Diogo (Dee-OH-Goo) and I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mental Health at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While I began my academic training in social and clinical neuroscience, I am now a public health researcher seeking to understand how policy shapes the physical and mental well-being of people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (I/DD) -- with particular attention towards long-term services and supports in community settings. My dissertation work explores the impact of US state policies on the stability of the direct support professional workforce, and how the latter facilitates community participation for adults with I/DD. 

As the sibling of an autistic adult with an intellectual disability, I am commited to collaborating with self-advocates, family advocates, and community leaders to promote inclusion through both policy and community action. While my main line of research is US-centric, as a Portuguese-Cape Verdean international student, I am interested in building cross-national partnerships to facilitate knowledge exchange and care capacity building.

In my free time, I am an avid enjoyer of board games, spending time with my cat Minerva (picture included), and am currently learning how to sew!
